5. Use Case: How a User Can Use the App
Meet Alex, a Software Developer
Alex is a busy software engineer who often works long hours and feels exhausted. He wants to monitor his stress levels and prevent burnout.
Step 1: Sign Up & Personalization
    - Alex downloads the Burnout Detector app and signs up using his email.
    - The app asks for his daily routine (work hours, break times, mood).
    - Alex also grants permission to integrate with Google Fit for tracking his sleep and activity levels.
Step 2: Daily Check-ins
    - Every day, Alex logs his work hours, stress levels, and mood.
    - If he feels stressed, he adds a note describing how he feels.
    - The AI analyzes his patterns and assigns a burnout risk score.
Step 3: AI Burnout Prediction
    - The app analyzes Alex’s data (work hours, stress levels, mood, sleep patterns).
    - It provides a burnout score (e.g., Low, Medium, High) with a graph showing trends over time.
    - If burnout risk is high, the app sends an alert with recommended actions.
Step 4: Personalized Burnout Prevention
    - Since Alex’s burnout risk is increasing, the app suggests:
      - Take a break every 60 minutes.
      - Try breathing exercises to relax.
      - Sleep at least 7 hours for better recovery.
      - Reduce work overload by delegating tasks.
Step 5: Monitoring & Insights
    - Over time, Alex tracks his burnout trends using graphs.
    - The app sends motivational reminders to maintain a healthy work-life balance.
    - If Alex improves, the app celebrates his progress with positive reinforcement.
Final Benefit
After using the Burnout Detector, Alex feels more in control of his work-life balance. He has reduced stress, sleeps better, and avoids burnout before it becomes a serious problem.
